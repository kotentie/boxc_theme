  			</div>
  			<div class="panel-body">
    			<h5 class="ul">For Shopify Merchants:</h5>
				- If you have set your BOXC Account to "Fulfill All Orders" we will automatically import your new orders each day and process them for Fulfillment.<br><br>
				- If you have set your BOXC Account to "Only Fulfill Orders I Specify" you will sign into your Shopify Admin Dashboard, select the Orders you want to send to BOXC for Fulfillment, and apply the "FBB: For Fulfillment" Internal Order Tag to the Order (this tag will be generated when you initialize your Shopify Shop in your BOXC setup process).<br><br>
				<h5 class="ul">For Orders originating on other eCommerce Platforms:</h5>
				- Use your eCommerce Platform's Order Export feature to upload a CSV of the orders you want us to fulfill.

    			<h3 class="panel-title">What happens if my Products are out-of-stock?</h3>
  			</div>
  			<div class="panel-body">
    			- If we do not have sufficient inventory on-hand to fulfill one or all of an Order's Line Items we will Tag the Order as "FBB: Out of Stock", which will prevent the Order from being sent to our Fulfillment Center until your Product/s is/are back in stock.<br><br>
				- Each time we receive a new Product shipment we will look for Orders tagged as Out of Stock, and will remove the Tag and process the Order for Fulfillment if the new inventory levels meet the demand of your backorders.

  			</div>
  			<div class="panel-body">
    			- BOXC will send you an email when your current supply levels reach less than 20% of your previous stocking quantity. For example, if you send us 1,000 Widgets we will email you as soon as we Fulfill the Order that drops your current supply to less than 200.
